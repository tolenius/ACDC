The example input data in this folder has been calculated with the previously used B3LYP//RICC2 method, as decribed in the paper
Olenius et al.: Free energy barrier in the growth of sulfuric acid–ammonia and sulfuric acid–dimethylamine clusters, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 084312 (2013), https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4819024

Newer quantum chemical data sets are recommended for improved quantitative assessments of cluster formation for different chemistries.
